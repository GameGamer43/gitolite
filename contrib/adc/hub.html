<h1>the 'hub' ADC</h1>

<p>This ADC (admin-defined command) helps collaboration among repos.  The name is
in honor of github, which is the primary host for gitolite itself.</p>

<p>[Note that github is a web-based service, and does a lot more, like comments,
code reviews, etc., none of which are possible here.  We're only talking about
some basic stuff to make the most common operations easier.  In particular,
this system is not a replacement for normal project communications like
email!]</p>

<p><strong>Conventions used</strong>: all through the following description, we will assume
that <strong>Alice</strong> has a repo <strong>parent</strong>, <strong>Bob</strong> has a fork of parent called
<strong>child</strong>, and he is asking Alice to pull a branch he made called <strong>b1</strong> from
child to parent.</p>

<p>In plain git (without using github or similar), the pull request process
starts with an email from Bob to Alice, followed by Alice running a <code>git fetch
&lt;Bob's URL&gt; b1</code> (optionally preceded by a <code>git remote add</code> for convenience of
long term use).  Until this happens she can't see much detail about the
commits to be pulled.</p>

<p>What this ADC does is (a) collect all the pull requests she needs to look at
in one place, and (b) allow her to examine the changes with any combination of
<code>git log</code> and <code>git diff</code> options <em>without having to fetch the content first</em>.</p>

<p>In a situation where there may be lots of requests, being able to take a quick
look at them (and possibly reject some), without having to pull down anything
at all, could be very useful.</p>

<p>Once past that level, she could get the changes down to her workstation using
<code>git fetch</code> as normal.  With this ADC, however, she has another alternative:
get them over to <code>parent</code> (her repo) on the same gitolite server, then later
do a normal <code>git fetch [origin]</code> to get it to her workstation.  This has the
added advantage that other people, who may be watching her repo but not Bob's,
now get to see what Bob sent her and send comments etc.</p>

<hr />

<p>The general syntax is</p>

<pre><code>ssh git@server hub &lt;hub-command&gt; &lt;args&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The following commands do not cause a fetch, and should be quite fast:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bob sends a pull request for branch b1 to repo parent.  Notice he does not
mention Alice by name.  This command expects a message to be piped/typed
in via STDIN [this message is meant to be transient and is not stored long
term; use email for more "permanent" communications].</p>

<pre><code>request-pull child b1 [parent]
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>child</code> was created by a recent version of the 'fork' ADC (or the KDE
'clone' ADC), which records the name of the parent repo on a fork, and it
is <em>that</em> repo to which Bob wishes to send the pull request, the third
argument is optional.</p></li>
<li><p>Bob lists the status (fetched/rejected/pending) of pull requests he has
made from his repo child to repo parent.  (Note we don't say "accepted" but
"fetched"; see later for why):</p>

<pre><code>request-status child [parent]
</code></pre>

<p>The second argument is optional the same way as the 3rd argument in the
previous command.</p></li>
<li><p>Alice lists requests waiting for her to check and possibly pull into
parent.  For each waiting pull request, she will see a serial number, the
originating repo name (child, in our example), the requestor (Bob, here),
and the branch/tag-name (b1) being pulled:</p>

<pre><code>list-requests parent
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Alice views request # 1 waiting to be pulled into parent.  Shows the same
details as above for that request, followed by the message that Bob typed
in when he ran <code>request-pull</code>:</p>

<pre><code>view-request parent 1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Alice views the log of the branch she is being asked to pull.  Note that
this does NOT involve a fetch, so it will be pretty fast.  The log starts
from b1, and stops at a SHA that represents any of the branches in parent.
Alice can use any git-log options she wants to; for instance <code>--graph</code>,
<code>--decorate</code>, <code>--boundary</code>, etc., could be quite useful.  However, she
can't use any GUI; it has to be 'git log':</p>

<pre><code>view-log parent 1 &lt;git log options&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the repo name Alice supplies is still her own, although the
log comes from the child repo that Bob wants Alice to pull from.  It's
best if you think of this as "view the commits from pull request #1 in
'parent'".</p></li>
<li><p>Alice views the diff between arbitrary commits on child:</p>

<pre><code>view-diff parent 1 &lt;git diff options&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, she mentions <em>her</em> reponame but the diff's come from <code>child</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Alice doesn't like what she sees and decides to reject it.  This command
expects some text on STDIN as the rejection message:</p>

<pre><code>reject parent 1
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The following commands will actually fetch from child into parent, and may take
time if the changes are large.  However all this is on the server so it does
not involve network traffic:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Alice likes what she sees so far and wants to fetch the branch Bob is
asking her to pull.  Note that we are intentionally not using the word
"accept", because this command does not (and cannot, since it is running
on a bare repo on the server) do a pull.  What it does is it fetches into
a branch whose name will be <code>requests/child/b1</code>.</p>

<p>Note that when multiple requests from the same repo (child) for the same
branch (b1) happen, each "fetch" overwrites the branch.  This allows Bob
to continually refine the branch he is requesting for a pull based on
(presumably emailed) comments from Alice.  In a way, this is a "remote
tracking branch", just like <code>refs/remotes/origin/b1</code>.</p>

<pre><code>fetch parent 1
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, you're done with the <code>hub</code> ADC.  However, all this is on the
bare <code>parent.git</code> on the server, and nothing has hit Alice's workstation yet!
Alice will still have to run a fetch or a pull on her workstation if she wants
to check the code in detail, use a tool like gitk, and expecially to
compile/test it.  <em>Then</em> she decides whether to accept or reject the request,
which will have to be communicated via email, of course; see the second para
of this document ;-)</p>
